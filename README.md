# TicTacToe-Game

A TicTacToe command line application written in JAVA. I am planning to build upon this basic version and convert it into a fully functional GUI gaming application.

### To-Do:

1. Improve the AI bot. (Make it more smarter)
2. Convert the command line application to a GUI application
3. Create a basic database to store maximum winning/losing streak
4. Add proper comments to the code
